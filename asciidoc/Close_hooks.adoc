== Close hooks

Close hooks is an internal feature of Vert.x useful for creating components that are notified when a `Verticle`
or a `Vertx` instance is closed. It can be used for implementing _automatic clean-up in verticles_
feature, like for a Vert.x http server.

The contract for receving a close notification is defined by the `io.vertx.core.Closeable` interface and
its `close(Handler<AsyncResult<Void>> completionHandler)` method:

[source,java]
----
public class ContextCloseHook implements Closeable {

  private final Context context;

  public ContextCloseHook(Vertx vertx) {
    this.context = vertx.getOrCreateContext();

    // Get notified when this context closes
    context.addCloseHook(this);
  }

  @Override
  public void close(Handler<AsyncResult<Void>> completionHandler) {
    // Create a new future
    Future<Void> fut = Future.future();

    // Set the close handler to be notified when the future resolves
    fut.setHandler(completionHandler);

    // Do cleanup, the method will complete the future
    doClose(fut);
  }

  /**
   * API close method - this is called by the user
   */
  public void close() {

    // Remove the hook
    context.removeCloseHook(this);

    // Do cleanup, the method will complete the future
    doClose(Future.future());
  }

  private void doClose(Future<Void> fut) {

    // No-op, in reality it would be a resource like a Netty channel, a file, etc...
    fut.complete();
  }
}
----

A `Closeable` instance can be registered to receive a close hook with the method
The method `Context#addCloseHook` registers a `Closeable` instance to be notified when the context closes:

[source,java]
----
context.addCloseHook(closeable);
----

This is only valid for Verticles, when a Verticle is undeployed, its associated context is closed and
the shutdown hooks are processed.

The component should still expose a `close` in its API to allow the user to close explicitly the resource, this
method should call `Context#removeCloseHook` to remove the hook.

[source,java]
----
context.removeCloseHook(closeable);
----

Likewise `VertxInternal` provides the same operation to receive notifications when a `Vertx` instance is closed.
